If you're reading this file, that means that you found a directory that
is empty by default when Wicd is installed. Congratulations!

At this point, the directory probably isn't empty, so perhaps the name
of this file is a little confusing.

Some package managers and some version control systems don't allow for
installation or storage of empty directories, so this file exists to
make them work properly. Just ignore it and continue on with your life.
